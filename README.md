# Colorado Election Audit Analysis
---


# Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections will be performing an election audit of the tabulated results for US congressional precinct in Colorado. The aspects that will be taken into consideration will be:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

After obtaining and auditing that information we will be adding the following data:

- The vote turnout for each county.
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
- The county with the highest turnout.

## The power of participation
The purpose of adding this data is to get parameters on the actual percentage of the population in voting age that are participating in the taking of electoral decisions for the wellbeing of their state. It is crutial to encourage and emphasize the importance of every citizen's participation to respect the rights of every social, racial and cultural population group. Broaden and incrementing the sample taken when taking decisions through a voting process ensures the best decision is always taken.
